                <h2>WHY CHOSE US?</h2>
                <P>Our raincoats are made from waterproof and breathable fabrics such as Gore-Tex, Tyvek, and DWR-coated nylon. These fabrics and allow water vapor to pass through, allowing the garment to "breathe" and wick away the wearer`s perspiration. We ofcourse also have non-breathable raincoats spesialized for mist.</P>

                <p>Our products are designed to move as naturally as possible by mimicking the shape of the human body. This has a significant impact on safety, comfort, and performance.</p>
                <p>The shoulders, back, and elbows interact with each other. Tightening due to lack of range of motion can affect harness functionality, limit reach, and expose you to cold.</p>
                <p>Our collection works together to give you freedom of movement without adding unnecessary materials. This streamlined fit has become a signature of the Rainydays brand.</p>
