            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <h2>Seek discomfort by pushing the comfortzone.</h2>
            <p>A local group of strangers dissatisfied with how the climate can limit their time outdoors. where we come from we have a saying, "bad weather doesn`t exist only bad clothes".  well, we had jackets that could hold us warm but not durable and functional ones for active movement. We threw away our big jackets and started working on a better experience for those who love to spend their time outdoors. And the rest is history
